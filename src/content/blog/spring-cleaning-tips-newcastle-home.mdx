The sun is shining, the birds are singing, and spring has arrived in Newcastle! After being cooped up indoors all winter, it's finally time to throw open the windows and give your home a deep clean. While regular house cleaning helps maintain order, there's no substitute for an annual spring clean to renew and revive your living space.

At [Pure Cleaning Newcastle](https://purecleaningnewcastle.com.au), we offer top-notch [spring cleaning services](https://purecleaningnewcastle.com.au/deep-cleaning-newcastle) to help Newcastle homeowners get their homes sparkling. Our team is equipped with the tools and know-how to get your home looking and feeling fresh after a long winter. But we also know many people prefer to tackle spring cleaning themselves.

If you're gearing up to do some spring cleaning around your Newcastle home, keep these handy tips from the professionals in mind:

- Start at the Top
Begin your spring cleaning journey at the highest points in each room and work your way down. Clear cobwebs from ceilings and vents first, then dust shelves, picture frames, and other surfaces at eye level. Finish each room by vacuuming and mopping the floors last.

- Double Up On Glass
Make your windows and mirrors streak-free by using a two-step cleaning process. First, use a vinegar spray or another glass cleaner to remove grime and dirt. Then go over the glass a second time with a microfiber cloth and plain water for a sparkling finish.

- Rotate and Vacuum Mattresses
While changing your sheets over to lighter, airier fabrics for spring, take the opportunity to rotate and vacuum your mattresses. Rotating helps prevent body indentations, while vacuuming picks up dust mites and other allergens.

- Don't Forget the Garage
The garage tends to be the recipient of indoor cold weather clutter tossed aside for sorting later. Make a point of cleaning and reorganizing the garage this spring, clearing out items you no longer use.

- Clean From the Inside Out
Tend to indoor spaces first before moving on to exterior areas like patios, decks, and gardens. It prevents you from tracking outdoor dirt and debris back inside after cleaning up the yard.

- Stock Up On Cleaning Supplies
Make sure you have plenty of rags, trash bags, cleaning solutions, and any other tools you'll need for your big spring clean. Running out partway through is a surefire way to kill your motivation!

At [Pure Cleaning Newcastle](https://purecleaningnewcastle.com.au), we have all the supplies and manpower to make quick work of spring cleaning if you'd prefer to leave it to the professionals. Whether you're doing it yourself or calling in reinforcements, we wish you a happy, sparkling spring season in Newcastle!
